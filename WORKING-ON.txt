Was working on making the UserService actually get an user value when logging on. Right now, the User Subject will never actually get an User. 
The next step is making sure that the API Gateway can grab an user utilizing the existing backend methods. Then it should return that properly 
crafted user to the UserService, which will set it's subject value to it. 

You should probably also make sure that the idToken is sent for the user, since that should be available in local storage and is not. 
Actually, local storage might not even be needed. Think about refactoring that out after you get this bullshit running.
